We&rsquo;ve all heard of the Matrix (hello Neo!) but do we remember it&rsquo;s round?
We live on a spherical planet, not in a single grid-iron city of XY city
blocks.
</p><p>
Enter the hexagon with twelve pentagons as a way of tiling and
we&rsquo;re back to a more globe friendly game board, data display, or &ldquo;macroscope&rdquo;
if you will.
</p><p>
Fine tune your heuristics and find a future revealed, using &ldquo;the hexapent&rdquo;
as your new crystal ball, and world gamer&rsquo;s paradise all rolled into one.
</p><p>
Join an insider circle of savvy investors hot on the trail of the
global Zeitgeist.
</p><p>
Glenn noticed an emerging trend in the 1990s, away from rectilinear models
and structures and towards a more sphere-friendly grid.
</p><p>
He was not alone in experiencing this shift (great minds think alike), by
definition of what we mean by Zeitgeist (or Noosphere if you prefer).
Books like <i>Beyond the Cube</i>, and geodesic domes by Buckminster Fuller were
more harbingers of the &ldquo;new aesthetics&rdquo;. The philosopher Peter
Sloterdijk is likewise on top of it.
</p><p>
He does have a front row seat however and is eager to share his perspective.
Prepare to synergize, as you start to recognize, and share a sense of, the
Global Matrix.
</p><p>
Fine tune your heuristics and find a future revealed, using &ldquo;the hexapent&rdquo;
as your new crystal ball, and world gamer&rsquo;s paradise all rolled into one.
</p><p>
Glenn&rsquo;s series of publications will connect many dots already out there,
saving you following trails of bread crumbs already decoded by a master
&ldquo;decryptographer&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In treating nature as a code, Glenn has discovered many keys.  Join him
at the front lines and get inspired to weave new stories of your own
incorporating these new memes.
</p><p>
Glenn&rsquo;s background as an NSA-trained cryptographer helped him discover
the key mindset.  Let him take you into his world, as a storyteller and
tour guide.  Some love of geometry required.
