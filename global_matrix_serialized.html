We&rsquo;ve all heard of the Matrix (hello Neo!) but do we remember it&rsquo;s round?  
We live on a spherical planet, not in a single grid-iron city of XY city 
blocks.  
</p><p>
Enter the hexagon with twelve pentagons as a way of tiling and 
we&rsquo;re back to a more globe friendly game board, data display, or &ldquo;macroscope&rdquo; 
if you will.
</p><p>
Fine tune your heuristics and find a future revealed, using &ldquo;the hexapent&rdquo; 
as your new crystal ball, and world gamer&rsquo;s paradise all rolled into one.
</p><p>
Join an insider circle of savvy investors hot on the trail of the global 
Zeitgeist.  
</p><p>
Glenn&rsquo;s series of publications will connect many dots already out there, 
saving you following trails of bread crumbs already decoded by a master 
&ldquo;decryptographer&rdquo;.  Glenn helps us crack nature&rsquo;s codes.  
Let him help 
you too.
</p><p>
In treating nature as a code, Glenn has discovered many keys.  Join him 
at the front lines and get inspired to weave new stories of your own 
incorporating these new memes.
</p><p>
Glenn&rsquo;s background as an NSA-trained cryptographer helped him discover 
the key mindset.  Let him take you into his world, as a storyteller and 
tour guide.  Some love of geometry required.
